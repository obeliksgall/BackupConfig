### üìÑ Log Format

Logs are saved in `Logs\BackupConfig_CurrentLog.txt` with entries like:

```
2025-09-27 10:55:30 [INFO] Backup script started
2025-09-27 10:55:30 [WARN] BackupDirs.txt not found. Creating...
2025-09-27 10:55:31 [ERROR] Specified path not found: D:\InvalidDir
```

When the log exceeds 512 KB, it is archived as:
```
Logs\BackupConfig_20250927_1055.txt
```

Only the 7 most recent archived logs are retained.
